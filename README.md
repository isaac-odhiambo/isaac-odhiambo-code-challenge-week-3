# Movie Theater Webpage

This project is a simple movie theater webpage that displays the details of movies, allows users to view available tickets, and "buy" tickets for a showing. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic user interface.

## Features

- Display the first movie's details (poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets) when the page loads.
- Show a list of all movies on the left side of the page.
- Update movie details when a movie in the list is clicked.
- Allow users to "buy" tickets by clicking a button, which decreases the number of available tickets on the frontend.

## Endpoints

- `GET /films/1`: Retrieve the details of the first movie.
- `GET /films`: Retrieve a list of all movies.

## Example Responses
